#### Description:
LiftTrack is a streamlined and intuitive web application designed to help users organize and track their workout routines throughout the week. With a focus on simplicity and usability, LiftTrack allows users to plan exercises for each day of the week, manage sets and repetitions, and even add supersets—all from an easy-to-use interface.

Key Features:
Daily Exercise Planner: The website includes seven days of the week, each represented by a large, visually appealing button that directs the user to the corresponding workout plan for that day. Each day's page allows users to add exercises, define sets, and track repetitions with ease.

Supersets: Each exercise can include a superset—a secondary exercise linked to the main one—allowing users to add extra intensity to their workouts.

Rest Day Option: Users can mark specific days as "rest days" by checking a box next to each day. When checked, the day button changes color and becomes unclickable, indicating a day of rest.

Dynamic Interface: The website enables users to dynamically add exercises and sets as needed. Users can also remove individual exercises as their workout plan evolves.

Auto-Save Functionality: LiftTrack automatically saves user input, ensuring that all workout information is retained, even after navigating away from the page.

LiftTrack is an ideal tool for fitness enthusiasts who want to plan, execute, and track their workouts effectively throughout the week, all while keeping the experience visually simple and efficient.

Files:
index.hmtl: It features a clean and modern layout with buttons for each day of the week arranged vertically. Each button is linked to the respective day's workout page (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.). To the left of each button is a checkbox labeled "Rest day," allowing users to mark a day as a rest day. When checked, the button changes to a less opaque green color and becomes unclickable. The page is designed to be visually appealing with large, easily clickable buttons and a central title.

monday.html: The monday.html file serves as a comprehensive workout management page specifically for Monday. It allows users to customize their workout by setting a personalized title, such as "Monday: Chest Day," which reflects the focus of their exercise routine. Users can dynamically add exercise tables to the page, each representing a different workout. Within these tables, they can manage their sets by adding rows for each set and specifying the number of repetitions. The "Add Set" button facilitates this process. Additionally, users have the option to incorporate supersets into their workout plans; this feature introduces two new columns for each row in the exercise table—one for the name of the superset exercise and one for its repetitions. To ensure data management, the page includes an auto-save feature that preserves user input automatically. Users can also remove exercises and sets as needed and navigate back to the home page using a convenient "Home" button located at the top left corner. This file is the exact same for the other days, except the title names for the given day.
